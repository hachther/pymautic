```python
from pymautic import MauticClient

# Initialize the client
client = MauticClient('username', 'password', 'https://your-mautic-instance.com')
```

### Managing Contacts

#### Create a Contact

```python
contact_data = {
    'firstname': 'John',
    'lastname': 'Doe',
    'email': 'john.doe@example.com',
    'ipAddress': '192.168.1.1',
}

response = client.contacts.create(contact_data)
print(response)
```

#### Get a Contact by ID

```python
contact_id = 1
response = client.contacts.get(contact_id)
print(response)
```

#### Update a Contact

```python
contact_id = 1
update_data = {
    'firstname': 'Jane',
    'lastname': 'Doe'
}

response = client.contacts.update(contact_id, update_data)
print(response)
```

#### Delete a Contact

```python
contact_id = 1
response = client.contacts.delete(contact_id)
print(response)
```

### Managing Segments

#### Create a Segment

```python
segment_data = {
    'name': 'New Segment',
    'alias': 'new-segment',
    'description': 'A new segment created via API'
}

response = client.segments.create(segment_data)
print(response)
```

#### Add a Contact to a Segment

```python
segment_id = 1
contact_id = 1
response = client.segments.add_contact(segment_id, contact_id)
print(response)
```

### Managing Campaigns

#### Create a Campaign

```python
campaign_data = {
    'name': 'New Campaign',
    'description': 'A new campaign created via API',
    'isPublished': True
}

response = client.campaigns.create(campaign_data)
print(response)
```

#### Add a Contact to a Campaign

```python
campaign_id = 1
contact_id = 1
response = client.campaigns.add_contact(campaign_id, contact_id)
print(response)
```

### Managing Assets

#### Upload an Asset

```python
file_path = '/path/to/your/file.pdf'
response = client.assets.upload(file_path)
print(response)
```

### Managing Forms

#### Get Form Submissions

```python
form_id = 1
response = client.forms.get_submissions(form_id)
print(response)
```

### Managing Emails

email_id = 1
contact_id = 1
response = client.emails.send(email_id, contact_id)

## Rate Limiting

The Mautic API has rate limits in place to prevent abuse. This client automatically handles rate limiting by waiting the appropriate amount of time before retrying the request.
